# mtg_color

Do you absolutely need to be able to represent the colors of Magic the Gathering cards (or other game objects) in a single byte? Are ergonmics irrelevant and storage space non-negotiable?

Features:
no-std compatible
only 14 bytes shared bytes needed for all canonical symbol information (compared to 80 bytes for a naieve implementation)
already at a stable 1.0.0 release
zero dependencies
there aren't any others
but extra lines for feature
always look good
